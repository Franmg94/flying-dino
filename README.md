## 1. Define MVP

The board is moving horizontally with obstacles that the player needs to avoid jumping 

The player can only move vertically, and the force of gravity is always present, meaning that the player is always moving down except when we press a key to move up. 

The player has to go jump through the obstacles.

## 2. Define Milestones

Milestone1: Display the player and one obstacle

- Player movement up and down
- Obstacle movement towards the left

v2: Generate collision and new obstacles

- Identify collision and stop game
- Create new obstacles that are removed when reached the end

v3: Diversity of obstacles and physics

- Create a pattern of obstacles that the player needs to avoid (the distance of the empty space of the obstacles affects the difficulty of the user experience)
- Adjust the speed of the movement of the obstacles and the movement of the player
- Implement physics for the player (gravity)

v4: Make it pretty

- Find images background
