# Flying Dino

Welcome to my first project, created during my time at Ironhack, where I've employed HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to craft a simple yet exciting platform game.

### Description:
This project is a simple platform game where you accompany Dino on a quest to survive the apocalypse, taking on waves of enemies along the way.

### Objective:
Your goal is to endure for 60 seconds and strive to eliminate as many enemies as possible. Keep an eye on your health points (HP) because if they reach zero, it's game over. Be cautious! Falling down or getting hit by enemies will deplete your HP.

### Controls:

- Use the arrow keys to navigate your character.
- Press the Space Bar to unleash powerful shots.

Enjoy the adventure and have a blast as you take flight with Dino!
